                <h2>Who We are</h2>
                <p>
                    After returning to the United States in 1989, Menlo collaborated with Warner P. Woodworth and Steven H. Mann. 
                    
                    The three men organized a team of graduate students who studied opportunities and developed networking contacts 
                    
                    in the Philippines.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1990 the dream came to life in the creation of Mentors International, a charitable organization offering a 
                    transformational program of mentoring, business training, and financial services to impoverished entrepreneurs
                    The first partner organization was organized in Manila, and then expanded to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, 
                    Peru, and Ghana. Each organization has its own local board of directors and native staff, and is a subsidiary of 
                    Mentors International and is supervised by the US management team. Mentors International provides start-up support,
                    training, operational funding, and loan capital for the partner organizations.
                    <br><br>
                    Over 4.3 million entrepreneurs are now enjoying the sweetness of prosperity because one man wanted to make a difference. 
                    They have decent housing. Their children are in school. They have at least two meals a day where one had been their norm. 
                    Nearly $77 million has been loaned through the micro-lending program with a 97% historical repayment rate.
                    While the world does feel good for the entrepreneurs served, many more are waiting for their opportunity.
                    You can make a difference, too.

            <h2>What we Do</h2>
            <P>
                As a Non-Profit 501-c, through the generous donations of our partners, we are helping to lift the impoverished in developing countries to 
                become self-reliant. We do this by helping aspiring entrepreneurs receive critical business training, making a small loan and letting them work 
                with dignity to support their families.
                <br><br>
                They lack education, good nutrition, and a safe place to raise their families. They cope with harsh social, economic, and environmental hardships.
                Inherited hunger, chronic malnourishment, and stunted growth have negative long-term effects on a child’s working capacity and intellectual 
                performance. These serious effects reach far into adulthood. Such nutritional problems are prevalent in developing countries as are illness, disease, 
                ignorance, abuse, and degrading customs.
                <br><br>
                Because there is no formal economy, a majority of the populations in developing countries can’t find work. They must fend for themselves and their 
                families without the resources they need to succeed.
                <br><br>
                Many organizations provide micro finance and training to the poor. Mentors International is different from these organizations not because 
                of what we do, but how we do it. The importance of how we serve shows up in our results.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, a loan is often not the most important resource. Clients need to first have the vision and confidence to work toward a new future. Mentors 
                International connects clients to all the necessary resources to create sustainable businesses.  
                <br><br>
                However, the way in which Mentors connects a client to a resource is the most remarkable part of our story. No bureaucracy. No outsourcing. An organization 
                designed so efficiently, that we empower clients and connect them to a usable resource. An organization so transparent, our CEO knows almost all of the loan 
                officers and many of our clients by name. An organization so trusted, many successful clients donate what little time and resources they have to Mentors to 
                serve others.
                <br><br>

                        Latin America grows some of the best-tasting potatoes in the world. Micaela Sales Hernandez is a potato farmer from Huehuetenango, 
                        Guatemala. In the spring Micaela applied for a farming loan from Mentors Guatemala. She used this money to invest in seed potatoes 
                        and organic fertilizers to help ensure her potatoes plants would grow and thrive.
                        <br>
                        Micaela is very excited to see the fruits of her labor. Farming is very difficult work, but for Micaela, it is very rewarding to experience 
                        every stage of the farming process. "My farm is producing much more now because I am able to purchase fertilizer with my loan from Mentors 
                        Guatemala. I love meeting with the mentors and showing them my progress and how my farm is improving. I am very grateful that Mentors 
                        Guatemala is there to support and help farmers like me. I am now able to afford to feed my family more nutritious meals and we are very happy."

                        Dona Rosa Ramona Perez Lopez and her family worked a small farm that helped to feed their family and provided them with a small income. 
                        Her goal was to change their way of life. When Rosa was introduced to Mentors Guatemala she was very 
                        eager for the opportunity to learn how to provide a better income for her family.
                        <br>
                        With her first loan she invested in a larger variety of seeds for her farm. Now she successfully plants peas, broccoli, beet, carrot, 
                        lettuce, and cabbage. Each harvest has become more successful and since she has a greater variety and quality of produce, her customers 
                        are eager to buy from her.
                        <br>
                        "I am very grateful for the trust and advice that was given to me from Mentors Guatemala. I want to continue progressing with my projects 
                        and business ideas. I tell everyone that I know about Mentors Guatemala. They are honest, trustworthy, and truly care about you and 
                        want to see you get ahead. Thank you so much for your support."

                    <img src="assets\Anyama-Korkor-750x330.jpg">
                    <p>
                        Ayama had the strong desire to improve the life of her family. She started her own business of selling smoked fish. She did not have access to 
                        any financial institutions to obtain additional funding to purchase more fish for her shop. She didn’t have any extended family that could loan 
                        her any money as well. Ayama didn’t give up and tried starting her business anyway. With little knowledge, she worked very hard and was able to 
                        bring in about $1.05 USD per day in profit. It was at this time that Ayama was introduced to Mentors Ghana by a friend. Ayama attended the 
                        business training classes and qualified for her first loan of $105 USD. She was finally able to go to the whole sellers and purchase a larger stock 
                        of fish.
                        <br>
                        Word of her delicious smoked fish spread, and Ayama's business continues to grow today. She appreciates the regular visits from Mentors Ghana to 
                        further progress her training and progress.
                        <br>
                        Ayama's customers started asking about getting fresh fish along with the smoked fish she was selling. Ayama approached Mentors Ghana and proposed 
                        how she wanted to increase the products she was offering her customers. She applied for another loan to purchase a deep freezer, which would allow 
                        her to sell fresh fish. A second loan was granted and Ayama's business experienced high growth. Within a year she was able to purchase an additional 
                        freezer as well as repay her loan. She now sells other frozen meats along with the fish. Her reputation as a respected business owner is known throughout 
                        her community.
                        <br>
                        Ayama says, "The lives of my family has improved greatly in just the few years of being associated with Mentors Ghana. I no longer worry about my husband’s 
                        ability to provide for our family. I am now able to take better care of him and feed my family more nutritious meals. Because of my income, I am building a 
                        new home for my family that is almost finished. I don’t know how to express the joy and happiness running through my soul because of Mentors Ghana. I can 
                        boast today that my fate and spirit has been renewed. Thanks to Mentors Ghana for being a father to the fatherless, and a helper for the helpless."
