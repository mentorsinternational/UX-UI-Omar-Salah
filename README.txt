This is a basic Home and Marketing page for Mentors International. An Charitable organization that links
impoverished citizens of the developing world with both crucial financial loans, as well as mentors int the
world of Entrepreneurship. 

This organization has tasked our team with creating an application that is geared to their affiliates around the
world and can:
        Create and Schedule reminders
                For both mentors and Mentees
                Create, Schedule, and send text reminders(independently of a mobile carrier)
                Create, and manage a contact list.

This is the marketing landing page for the newly designed, and released product developed by the team, as well as
a mock up design of a Home page for the company that links off to the new app log-in, and marketing pages.

The marketing page is designed to convert site traffic to users of the app.
