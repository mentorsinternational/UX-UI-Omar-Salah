This is a basic Home and Marketing page for Mentors International. An Charitable organization that links
impoverished citizens of the developing world with both crucial financial loans, as well as mentors int the
world of Entrepreneurship. 

This organization has tasked our team with creating an application that is geared to their affiliates around the
world and can:
        Create and Schedule reminders
                For both mentors and Mentees
                Create, Schedule, and send text reminders(independently of a mobile carrier)
                Create, and manage a contact list.

This is the marketing landing page for the newly designed, and released product developed by the team, as well as a mock up design
of a Home page for the company that links off to the new app log-in, and marketing pages.

The marketing page is designed to convert site traffic to users of the app.

# UX-UI-Omar-Salah
UX/UI 5 Week project.
User Interface Project Week

You are to treat this week as if you are working as a front end developer at a web development agency. The instructor is the owner of the agency and is under pressure from the client to deliver the product, a custom marketing website, on time. The project managers are acting as your supervisors.

This week you will be building a website for a non-profit. Mentor International have requested a minimum viable product to deliver to their board of directors by the end of the week. The requirements are listed below under MVP Features.Mentors International also have a wish list of extra features they would love to showcase to the board if you can get them done. You will demonstrate your work to the agency owner Thursday afternoon.

You will use Trello to report your progress on the MVP and any extra features you accomplish to your project managers every day during standup. This project is meant to be worked on by yourself. Do not pair program this week as this challenge is meant to show you where you can improve and what you have learned on your own.
Pro Tips For This Week:

    Use past solutions from the previous weeks to accomplish harder tasks
    Commit every time you accomplish any new functionality or layout. Get in the habit of frequent commits so you have a record of your work. Push up your commits every day to showcase your progress to your PM
    After 20 minutes of being stuck on something, reach out to your PM
    Don't overplan, start coding as soon as you can and adjust accordingly. Trello is there as a guide not as a distraction

Trello Set Up:

[x] Create a Trello account
[x] Create a new public board called "By Your Name"
[x] Create lists to help track tasks
[x] Fill in the To Do list with the MVP features listed below
[x] Fill in the stretch list with stretch tasks
[x] Share your board with the Project Manager that has been assigned to you. If you have not been assigned yet, reach out to your lead TA for guidance

Assets Provided:

[x] Nothing

MVP Features:

These MVP features represent the fundamental knowledge you should have obtained throughout the last 4 weeks. If you cannot accomplish all of the MVP tasks listed here, you may be a candidate for the mastery based program.

[x]    Build layout HTML/LESS: Home page mobile first design
[x]    Build layout HTML/LESS: Home page desktop design
        [X] Add breakpoints
[x]    Build layout style using LESS
        [x] Add mixins
        [x] Add variables
[x]    Build layout : Navigation system design
        [x] link to react app
[x]    Build Custom Component HTML/LESS/JavaScript

Once you have accomplished the required MVP features, reach out to your project manager for approval to work on extra features of your choice. This project does not end at MVP. Try to get as many extra features into your project as you can before the demonstration!

Extra Features:

Extra features are not in order of importance, it's just a list of features the client wishes they could have by the demo. Pick in any order you wish.

Remember: This is a self driven challenge, try to accomplish MVP as soon as you can and stretch as much as you can on extra features. Have fun with this and remember to reach out to your project managers after the 20 minute rule. Good luck!
