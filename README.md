# UX-UI-Omar-Salah
UX/UI 5 Week project.
User Interface Project Week

You are to treat this week as if you are working as a front end developer at a web development agency. The instructor is the owner of the agency and is under pressure from the client to deliver the product, a custom marketing website, on time. The project managers are acting as your supervisors.

This week you will be building a website for a non-profit. Mentor International have requested a minimum viable product to deliver to their board of directors by the end of the week. The requirements are listed below under MVP Features.Mentors International also have a wish list of extra features they would love to showcase to the board if you can get them done. You will demonstrate your work to the agency owner Thursday afternoon.

You will use Trello to report your progress on the MVP and any extra features you accomplish to your project managers every day during standup. This project is meant to be worked on by yourself. Do not pair program this week as this challenge is meant to show you where you can improve and what you have learned on your own.
Pro Tips For This Week:

    Use past solutions from the previous weeks to accomplish harder tasks
    Commit every time you accomplish any new functionality or layout. Get in the habit of frequent commits so you have a record of your work. Push up your commits every day to showcase your progress to your PM
    After 20 minutes of being stuck on something, reach out to your PM
    Don't overplan, start coding as soon as you can and adjust accordingly. Trello is there as a guide not as a distraction

Trello Set Up:

[x] Create a Trello account
[x] Create a new public board called "By Your Name"
[x] Create lists to help track tasks
[x] Fill in the To Do list with the MVP features listed below
[x] Fill in the stretch list with stretch tasks

MVP Features:

Once you have accomplished the required MVP features, reach out to your project manager for approval to work on extra features of your choice. This project does not end at MVP. Try to get as many extra features into your project as you can before the demonstration!

Extra Features:

Extra features are not in order of importance, it's just a list of features the client wishes they could have by the demo. Pick in any order you wish.

    

Remember: This is a self driven challenge, try to accomplish MVP as soon as you can and stretch as much as you can on extra features. Have fun with this and remember to reach out to your project managers after the 20 minute rule. Good luck!
