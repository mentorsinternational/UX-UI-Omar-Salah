            <h3>Create a Contacts List</h3>
            <p>
                As a Mentor one of the most important tasks is staying in contact with ALL your Mentees. It is hard to do in
                the developing world. Even maintaining a Contact book becomes hard.<br>
                this is why we built a Contact List right in!<br>

            <p>
                How can you help keep track of your Mentees projects, and businesses it you cant keep track of your own obligations?<br>
                Create your own text reminders to help keep you on track and checking in.

            Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many
            people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the
            nature of the Universe than we do now.
