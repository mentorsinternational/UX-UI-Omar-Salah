            <h3>Create a Contacts List</h3>
            <p>
                As a Mentor one of the most important tasks is staying in contact with ALL your Mentees. It is hard to do in
                the developing world. Even maintaining a Contact book becomes hard.<br>
                this is why we built a Contact List right in!<br>
                Create New, Edit, or Delete old contacts right in the app.
